Jansen to Rohit Sharma, 1 run
Full to start, just a hint of swing to straighten towards off stump. Clipped to the right of mid-on and Rohit is off the mark
    

0.2

Jansen to Kohli, FOUR runs
And a four first ball for Kohli! Gets a nice, juicy, wide half-volley first up, and he reaches out and meets it with a slightly open face to place it between backward point and cover point

0.3

Jansen to Kohli, FOUR runs
Back-to-back fours, and back-to-back freebies from Jansen. Another half-volley, but this one swings into Kohli's pads, and he clips it away neatly to the right of the man at midwicket

0.4
2
Jansen to Kohli, 2 runs
Another half-volley, just outside off this time, and Kohli gets a nice stride forward, bends his front knee to get his weight into the ball, and plays a checked drive betwen cover and mid-off

0.5
•
Jansen to Kohli, no run
Good length for the first time in this over, slanting across into the corridor, and immediately there's some carry, de Kock collecting just above his head after Kohli leaves it alone

0.6
4
Jansen to Kohli, FOUR runs
Another half-volley, close to off stump, and Kohli drives straight this time, between the stumps and the non-striker, and both mid-on and mid-off give chase but neither can catch up with the ball, though Nortje, running from mid-on, gets close enough to attempt a sliding save

Maharaj to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs
Just a touch back of a length, not a lot of width, but Rohit makes himself room to try and cut. A bit of extra bounce, a thick edge, and it flies away into the big gap between slip and backward point

1.2

Maharaj to Rohit Sharma, FOUR runs
India are absolutely flying here. On the shorter side of a length, and the line is outside off, and Rohit spots the line early and brings out the reverse-sweep, slaps it away behind backward point

Maharaj to Rohit Sharma, no run
Tightens his line, good length on off stump, defended to short extra-cover

Maharaj to Rohit Sharma, OUT
Gone, what a catch this is from Klaasen! Rohit continues to try and put pressure on Maharaj. Floated up slow outside off stump - 77kph - and he stretches out to sweep. Middles it, but doesn't really smash it, because he's reaching for the ball - ends up hitting it in the air to the left of square leg, where Klaasen takes a good, low diving catch two-handed

Maharaj to Pant, no run
Length ball outside off, presses forward and dabs towards backward point

1.6
W
Maharaj to Pant, OUT
Is that two wickets in the over for Maharaj? Two wickets off the sweep? South Africa think so. The umpires are checking for a bump ball. Goes for the sweep against a very full ball, and ends up meeting it on the full, in fact, outside off. And he's a goner. Straight up in the air off the top edge of the toe end, and it balloons up behind him to de Kock. What a turnaround in the space of three balls, after India had run away to a flier

Rabada to Kohli, no run
Fullish, angling in towards off stump, clipped to short midwicket

Abhijeet: "Rohit does it again. Successful in other games failure in finals. His super aggression doing more harm to the team than the good." -- What a wonderful thing hindsight is. A strategy is obviously good when it works, and obviously bad when it doesn't.

Rabada to Kohli, 1 run
Back of a length outside off, opens his bat face to dab to the left of point

Rabada to Suryakumar, no run
Hard length, straightens a touch towards the top of off, with a bit of extra bounce, squared up slightly while defending to short cover

Rabada to Suryakumar, 2 runs
Ooooh, just clears mid-on! Could be one of those sliding-doors moments. Length ball, hits the pitch hard, angling in towards off stump, and SKY goes for the wristy whip over mid-on, but doesn't middle it - the ball hit the bat pretty high up - and it loops up over mid-on, for a moment appearing catchable as the fielder turns around and begins to give chase, but the over-the-shoulder ball doesn't quite land within range

Maharaj to Kohli, no run
Quicker, straightens sharply on an off-stump line, squares up a little while defending off the back foot

3.3

Maharaj to Kohli, no run
Similar ball, but this time Kohli is right behind it to defend into the covers

Short, wide, slapped. Just sits up and Kohli stands up and whacks it away to the left of cover

Rabada to Suryakumar, OUT
Three down, and Rabada gets a huuuge wicket. Again, not necessarily a wicket-taking ball, and India's aggressive intent - which has served them so well through this tournament - goes against them. Steps across to a back-of-a-length ball angled in towards the stups, and whips it away, but close enough to fine leg for the fielder to move to his left and take a straightforward catch

Rabada to Axar Patel, FOUR runs
Full on the pads, and he puts it away, clips it neatly to the right of the diving square leg fielder

Rabada to Axar Patel, no run
Full, not quite a half-volley, slanting away from off stump, driven to cover point

4.6

Rabada to Axar Patel, 1 run
Slapped away, and backward point misfields. Maybe some bad bounce for the fielder. Shortish, slanting across into the corridor, gets on top of the bounce and hits it firmly down with a horizontal bat. Rolls away past backward point, but deep third moves left swiftly to cut it off
